# ImageTranslate

An application that uses Clarafai and Yandex API to describe an image in words and translate those keywords to Spanish.
I think an app like this would be useful to users visiting a foreign place, and can just snap a photo to learn spanish 
words based off keywords generated from the photo. Having just started web development and learning Node.JS, html, CSS, 
this is still a work in progress.
